## 0.1.0

First release of dart-parsing!

Composable, reusable, and extensible parsers for Dart.

`dart-parsing` is a small parsing library built around a minimal core abstraction. It lets you build expressive parser pipelines through composition, instead of relying on large regular expressions or complex, stateful parsing code.

The main goal is simple: write parsers that look like the grammar they implement.
